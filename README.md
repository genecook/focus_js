**focus_js** is a threaded desktop job server. Using **focus_js**, the user may
efficently schedule and run many thousands of individual jobs on a single
desktop client. **focus_js** started out as an internal tool, developed specifically
for use in testing a new microprocessor simulator implementation.

To use, either download and compile of course, or use one of the packaged releases (*debian* package or *gzip'd/tar* file). The packaged releases were compiled using *Gnu G++* version 5.4.0 and *Ubuntu Linux* version 16.04.5.
